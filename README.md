# Google-Books-React-20
Creating a Google Books Search App.

### Overview
In this activity I aim to create a React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment will require the use of React components, helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. The app will also utilize Node, Express, and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

### Search Function
The user will be able to search for books via the Google Books API and have them rendered on the page. The user will then have th option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" the book, saving it to a mongo database.

### Saved Books
This page will render all books that have been saved to the Mongo Database. The user will be able to "View" the book or "Delete" it.
